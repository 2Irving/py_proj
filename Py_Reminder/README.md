# Reminder (v0.1)

_pronounced "Reminder"_

This application is used to remind workers that when they concentrate on their work, 
it is often easy to ignore the activity required for a long time to sit down, 
so this focuses on:
1. Remind you to get up at the hour and half an hour (red window, and text reminder)
2. Remind you to sign in at the end of the day, you can customize the end of the day

It does not require any _root_ access. It works on _Linux_, _Windows_ and _macOS_.
